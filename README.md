# Lung-Cancer-Analysis
using R language
In this data analysis project, I explored a dataset related to lung cancer with using R language.

The findings reveal strong correlations between allergies and lung cancer, while highlighting more modest associations with smoking and anxiety, shedding light on potential risk factors for lung cancer development
